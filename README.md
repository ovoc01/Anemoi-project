## Why I create Anemoi ?
The Anemoi Framework is my endeavor to understand and implement a robust framework similar to Spring, inspired by Richard Feynman’s principle: “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” This framework aims to encapsulate a wide array of functionalities essential for building modern Java applications, mirroring the comprehensive features found in Spring.
